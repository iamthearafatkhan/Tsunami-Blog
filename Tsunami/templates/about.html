        <h2>What is a Tsunami?</h2>
        <p>A tsunami is a series of ocean waves caused by the sudden displacement of a large volume of water. They are often triggered by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. Unlike regular ocean waves, tsunamis have very long wavelengths and can travel at speeds of up to 500-800 kilometers per hour (310-500 mph).</p>

        <h2>Causes of Tsunami</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Earthquakes:</strong> Most tsunamis are generated by underwater earthquakes, especially those that occur in subduction zones where one tectonic plate is forced under another.</li>
            <li><strong>Volcanic Eruptions:</strong> Volcanic activity, including eruptions and the collapse of volcanic islands, can displace large amounts of water.</li>
            <li><strong>Landslides:</strong> Underwater landslides or landslides from nearby coasts can also cause tsunamis.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact Events:</strong> Rarely, the impact of a large meteorite or asteroid can generate tsunamis.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="my-4">
        <h2>Types of Tsunamis</h2>
        <p>Tsunamis can be classified into several types based on their origins:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Tsunamis:</strong> Generated close to shore and can reach the coastline within minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Regional Tsunamis:</strong> Occur in a specific region and can affect coastal areas hundreds of kilometers away.</li>
            <li><strong>Teletsunamis:</strong> Large tsunamis that can travel across entire ocean basins and affect distant shorelines.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="my-4">
        <h2>Tsunami Life Cycle</h2>
        <p>The life cycle of a tsunami includes several stages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Generation:</strong> The tsunami is generated by a disturbance in the water column.</li>
            <li><strong>Propagation:</strong> The tsunami waves travel across the ocean, maintaining their speed and energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Amplification:</strong> As the waves approach shallow waters near coastlines, they slow down and increase in height.</li>
            <li><strong>Inundation:</strong> The tsunami waves hit the shore, causing flooding and destruction.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdrawal:</strong> The water retreats back to the ocean, which can also pose dangers to people near the shore.</li>
        </ul>
